# PersonalWebsite
## This is a personal website, I am gonna try everything I learn in HTML!!

- At first I added "Under Construction" then a small paragraph
- I added links up and give them some style
- Updated style of those links and added a Github icon
- Made the link to highlight while clicked and opened the link in a new tab
- Made a button which gives details when clicked it
- Added a useless button(which is actually a hyperlink) which opens a blank dark theme html
